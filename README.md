# How to make the game

We can print the board game and 3D print the gamepieces using [This link](https://github.com/Entanglion/entanglion/tree/master/assets).
Or we can make the game ourselves :D
This is the purpose of this github repository. Our goal is to make a virtual version of the entanglion game.
